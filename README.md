# Awesomewm configuration

This is the configuration of awesomewm that I currently use.

## Widgets
I use the following widgets:
- the calendar widget from [awesome-wm-widgets](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets/tree/master/)
- the battery widget taken and adapted from [awesome-wm-widgets](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets/tree/master/)
- the volume widget inspired by [vivien/i3blocks-contrib](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib/tree/master/volume-pipewire) and [awesome-wm-widgets](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets/tree/master/), the icons were adapted from [awesome-wm-widgets](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets/tree/master/)
